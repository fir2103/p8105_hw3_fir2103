## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

instacart <- 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_fir2103_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |

| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

``` r
accel_data <- read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(day_type = as.factor(if_else(
    day == "Saturday"| day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")), 
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
                              "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", 
                              "Sunday")))%>%
  relocate(day_type, .before = activity_1) %>%
    pivot_longer(
    c(activity_1:activity_1440),
    names_to = "activity_min",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(activity_min = as.numeric(activity_min)) %>%
  arrange(day)
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

-   The tidied dataset contains 50400 rows (observations) and 6 columns
    (variables). The variables of the dataset are week, day_id, day,
    weekday (factor variable), activity_min (the minute of the day),
    activity_count.

Total activity (24-hour, aggregated all minutes) by day, week

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  group_by(day, week) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = as.integer(sum(activity_count))) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = "day", 
    names_from = "week", 
    names_prefix = "week_", 
    values_from = "total_activity"
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| day       | week_1 | week_2 | week_3 | week_4 | week_5 |
|:----------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Monday    |  78828 | 295431 | 685910 | 409450 | 389080 |
| Tuesday   | 307094 | 423245 | 381507 | 319568 | 367824 |
| Wednesday | 340115 | 440962 | 468869 | 434460 | 445366 |
| Thursday  | 355923 | 474048 | 371230 | 340291 | 549658 |

| Saturday  | 376254 | 607175 | 382928 |   1440 |   1440 |
| Sunday    | 631105 | 422018 | 467052 | 260617 | 138421 |

-   One trend apparent from the table is that the Saturday from week 3
    and week 4 have unusually low activity counts (both are 1440).
    Monday of week 1 has lower activity count than typical Monday
    activity counts.

Single-panel plot for activity counts over the course of the 24-hour
period by day

``` r
activity_plot <- accel_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_min, y = activity_count, color = day)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) + geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1260, 1440)) + 
  labs(x = "Activity Time", y = "Activity Count", title = "Activity count over 24-hour period")

    ## Saving 6 x 3.6 in image

-   Between 6 AM and 9 AM (360 and 540 minutes), activity counts for
    weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday) are higher than weekends.
-   Between 9 AM and 12 PM (540 and 720 minutes), activity counts are
    high - especially on Sundays.
-   Between 12 PM and 4/5 PM, there is a slump in activity counts on
    almost all days.
-   After 6 PM (1080 minutes), there is an increase in activity,
    especially on Fridays (around 9 PM).

## Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  as_tibble(ny_noaa)

ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

  mutate(month = month.abb[month],
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin), 
         tmax = tmax/10, 
         tmin = tmin/10,

-   The dataset has 2595176 rows (observations) and 9 columns
    (variables). The variables are `id` of the weather station, `month`,
    `day`, `year`, `prcp` (precipitation in mm), `snow` (in mm), `snwd`
    (snow depth in mm), `tmax` (maximum temperature in Celsius) and
    `tmin` (minimum temperature in Celsius). All weather data values are
    in integer form except `tmax` and `tmin` which are characters. The
    dataset was tidied by transforming from wide to long format, by
    changing the activity count variables and `prcp` and `tmin`, `tmax`
    variables changed.

-   There are many missing values of `tmax` and `tmin`. For both `tmax`
    and `tmin`, about 44% of the values are missing. More than 50% of
    the `prcp`, `snow`, `snwd` values are non-missing so the main
    problem arises with the temperature values.

-   For snowfall, the most common value is `0`. This is the case since
    if it snows, it only snows in most areas of New York from the months
    of November-February/March (therefore, not the majority of the
    year).

Two-panel plot showing average max temperature in January and in July in
each station across years

``` r
avg_max_plot <- ny_noaa %>% filter(month %in% c("Jan","Jul")) %>% 
  group_by(month, year, id) %>% 
  summarize(
    tmax_mean = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = tmax_mean, group = id)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(y = "Average Maximum Temperature", title = "Average Maximum Temperature in January vs July")
```

-   Average temperatures in January are obviously much lower than July -
    most average temperatures across stations are within 10 degrees
    Celsius of each other. The trends are pretty constant more or less.

-   There is an outlier in July 1986/1987 where the average maximum
    temperature at one station (15 degrees Celsius) was lower than the
    typical trend. There is a slight outlier around 1982 where the
    average maximum temperature was around -12 (lower than typical).
